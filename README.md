# Pathseq
Pathseq is a pipeline for identifying microbial content (bacteria or viruses) from metagenomic sequencing reads.\
Specifically, pathseq takes paired-end shotgun sequencing reads ->\
filters reads that are likely to be contamination (human, primate, mammalian) ->\
assembles remaining reads into contigs ->\
filters contigs for likely contamination ->\
taxonomically classifies and quantifies remaining contigs ->\
searches remaining unclassified contigs for RNA viral motifs (to find possible novel viruses)
